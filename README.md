My first Android Studio App. Only the APK is avalible as my original code was lost from a corrupted hard drive.
This project is being rewritten.

Aims to help make any reminder or checklist easier to manage and keep track on. Your checklist can be broken down 
into something more simple to read and edit in just a few clicks. These useful and simple features can be used online for sharing and editing
reminders and lists online.
